     <p>When it comes to coding, the basics are this: HTML is the place where you store the content (text, images, videos, links etc.) and CSS is the place that depicts how that content will be displayed (colour, font, size, position etc.).</p>
        
     <p>Class and ID selectors are used in both HTML and CSS. CSS is where you define what the class/ID consists of and how the content will look, and HTML is where you apply said definition to make it visible to the user. The very simple explanation is that a class selector can be used to identify more than one HTML element, whereas an ID selector can be used to identify only one.</p>

     <p>To differentiate between class and ID selectors in CSS, you use a full stop (".") for class and a hash sign for ID ("#").</p>
        
     <p>You want to use an ID selector when you have a very specific style for an element, like the positioning of a header on a webpage. It is important to note that you can only use an ID selector for it's given element once on per page, so use it wisely! </p>
        
     <p>You can use a class selector for pretty much everything else! (Personally, I prefer this option because it allows for more flexibility and less chance of me creating a bugâ€¦I think.)</p>
        
     <p>Let's keep in mind that this is a very rudimentary definition and that I am still very much a total noob. But I am learning (slowly, slowly), and that's got to count for something.</p>
