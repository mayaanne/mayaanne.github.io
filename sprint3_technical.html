            <h2>Javascript, HTML, CSS, DOM and DevTools</h2> 
            
            <p>HTML and CSS are two sides of the same coin, though you can have the former without the latter. HTML dictates the content that will be displayed on the web page, and CSS dictates <em>how</em> the content will be displayed (styling!). Think of it as though you were baking a cake. The cake mixture is the thing that you will eat, and the icing is the thing that you will use to decorate it (and also eat!).</p>
            
            <p>Control flow is the order in which the code in any given program is being executed. A loop is a sequence of instructions that allows said code to be executed repeatedly until a certain condition has been reached. Think of the two like washing the dishes––the control flow is the order that you wash the dishes in (hopefully cleanest to dirtiest and glassware through to pots and pans!!), and the loop is the repeated process of washing each dish until all of them have been cleaned.</p>
            
            <p>The DOM is a feature that allows the modification and manipulation of a web page without affecting the web page document in real time. You can use it to alter the way a web page looks without actually affecting the official website––all of the changes made are only on your own browser and will be deleted upon refresing the page.</p>            
            
            <p>An array is a single variable used to store different elements. An object is comparable to an everyday object, something that has it's own properties. An array stores a collection of data whereas an object is a collection of properties.The former allows you to distinguish between different variables while the latter holds an association between a name and a value.</p>

            <p>A function is defined by what it aims to do and is a process that performs a task in Javascript. A function is useful because it allows you to assign a single method to various objects without having to write out the same code repeatedly each time.</p>
