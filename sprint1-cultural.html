              <p><b>The question:</b> Explain a situation where you have to make an ethical decision.</p>

                <p><b>The answer:</b> "… … … … …"</p>
                
                <p><b>The problem:</b> My memory does not excel where it is supposed to. Have I ever had to make an ethical decision––surely, even if only once––in my life? I have never been any good at articulating explanations, especially not without having first been given an example. Can you give me the origin of the word? Could you use it in a sentence? Can I use my 'phone a friend'?</p>
                
                <p>Specifics are important but so are interpretations. This is mine.</p>
                
                <p>Self-reflection is something that I started practicing well before learning that therapists had long since claimed it. Keeping a journal for 15 years will do that––force you to look at yourself in the realest, most honest way. A sum of experiences, a blank page, a bleeding pen; it's an equation, and not one waiting to be solved but one simply wanting to be seen.</p> 
                
                <p>Born in Gisborne, I grew up with one foot in Maoridom and the other in a small, white, middle class town in the South Island. Going to the marae, eating hangi, speaking te reo Māori and understanding the power of karakia became one half of the two that I consisted of. That is, until the age of 4, when my family moved south and my new existence became my only existence. My Māori influence––already shaped and easily forgotten––was replaced with my mother's quiet spirituality, the only thing guiding me in a direction other than backwards.</p>
                
                <p>I am flighty, always in search of the next opportunity for exploration. I don't like to plan, only to do. If I am bored, you've already lost me. Sometimes I have too much faith in myself but more often, I have none. My dreams cannot be contained by sleeping and I have a greedy fearlessness that is forever in favour of quick fixes, fresh starts and abrupt endings. This attitude makes learning fast and career development slow. These are my limitations. These are the things that I will never give up.</p>
                
                <p>I am determined. When I decide on something––with all of my everything––it is already in motion. I am happy and I only want to be happy, in whichever form that may take. This makes life simpler, even on its most difficult days. I am adventurous, excited to reach the cliff and content in not jumping from it. I am curious and kinaesthetic, in constant search of an enthralling existence. I am a wanderer, a creator, a dreamer, a believer. These are my strengths, my most malleable and forgiving parts. These are the pieces that will remind me to breathe when I have forgotten how.</p>
                
                <p>I was raised in two very different spheres. The culture that came of this has influenced my values and identity significantly, sculpting me into the person I am today. I endeavour to see things from all perspectives, to listen before making judgement, to accept how one person's understanding of the world can differ so drastically from another's. Kindness is key; you never know where someone else has come from, nor the mountains that they have climbed to reach you.</p>
                
                <p>People don't always work how you want them to. Sometimes there is tension, resistance, an unrelenting wall of bigotry. When this happens, ask questions. Be open to rigid angles and stubborn mindsets. Listen and lead by example, encouraging flexibility where you can. Be kind; but first, be kind to yourself. When enough is enough, say it's enough. Do so with respect. Remember the battles that everyone has fought to get here.</p>
