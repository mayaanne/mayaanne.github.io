            <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2> 

         <p><em>What is emotional intelligence?</em></p>
            
            <p>Emotional intelligence is about being aware––aware of yourself, of others, and of your own behaviour and emotion. When utilising emotional intelligence, you can enlist self-reflection as a tool to process experiences, grievances and everyday events. Being emotionally intelligent means being empathetic, compassionate and understanding, not only to others but also to yourself.</p>
            
         <p><em>How is it different to IQ?</em></p>
            
            <p>Emotional intelligence is different to IQ in that it does not require any academic knowledge. IQ is centred around being traditionally 'book smart' and uses standardised testing to reach a score rating one's intelligence (not taking into account that there are many different forms of intelligence, but we need not go there). EQ is not something that can be graded but rather experienced, and is extremely beneficial when it comes to inter and intra personal communication.</p>
            
         <p><em>Why is it important?</em></p>
            
             <p>Emotional Intelligence is important because we are a people planet. As humans, we thrive off connection––whether that be with another person, an animal or nature. With EQ, we are able to understand the emotions and perspectives of others, which is paramount to resolving issues and conflict. It enables us to relate to one another in a compassionate and effective way.</p>
