    <h1>5 Fun Facts About Me</h1>

    <ol class="paragraph-styling" style="text-align: left;">
        <li class="spacing">I have a serious case of the travel bug!</li>
        <li class="spacing">In 2018, I spent several months (on separate occassions) trying out both a sugar-free and a vegan diet. Sadly (or gladly?), neither stuck.</li>
        <li class="spacing">I aspire to have a pet fox, a pet red panda, and a pet bat (but not a little bat––I want one like those massive bats in Queensland, the ones that fly right at you and then swerve away at the last second).</li>
        <li class="spacing">I was once strangled by an elephant.</li>
        <li class="spacing">My goal in life is to be a hippy-dippy travelling writer.</li>
    </ol>
