              <p>Self-directed learning has never really been my thing, nor has traditional education. I always had far too much energy, too excessive a passion for creativity. I was in a state of constant desire for more, for something else, for an exotic, adventurous existence that did not fit within the rigidity of the square world that I found myself in.</p>

              <p>My limitations are boundless, as are my strengths. It is important to note that where you have one, you will always have the other. I am determined yet unmotivated, curious yet often bored. Creativity is everything and yet if the road to get there is too long, too arduous and gruelling, I will simply take the closest fork and continue on in a different direction.</p>
              
              <p>I care too much about the final product, about making it perfect when all it really needs to be is complete. I get mad at myself when I don't perform well, when everyone else in the room understands a concept and no matter how obtusely I angle it, my eyes don't see what theirs do. I do what needs to be done, regardless as to whether I actually comprehend what I'm doing.</p>
              
              <p>Sometimes I have no faith in myself.</p>
              
              <p>Sometimes the scariest thing that I could ever feel is small.</p>
              
              <p>What I do know is that I have potential, buckets and buckets and buckets. When put to work, it sees me through. It reminds me that I have the power to do anything––to see, to breathe, to dream. I am stubborn with myself and flexible with others, capable of working autonomously and as part of a group.</p>
              
              <p>At the beginning of each week, I will make a rough plan as to the learning required for each day. I will aim to follow along with this guide, forgiving any setbacks and rejoicing in any speedy achievements. I will listen to my fellow students and facilitators, and focus when focus is due.</p>
              
              <p>When I am struggling, I will ask for help. I will reach out to facilitators, my cohort and anyone else who I think might be able to guide me back to a better place. I expect my facilitators to be there when I need them, to provide constructive feedback on my work and to ensure a positive learning experience.</p>
              
              <p>I am here because I want to learn, in search of a direction that goes anywhere but idle. This is a transitional period in my life, as I am sure it is for everyone else. I don't expect the transition to be smooth, but I do hope that it will be threaded with lighter days and giddy relief, with raucous laughter and copious, copious amounts of good.</p>
