            <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2> 

         <p><strong>Neuroplasticity</strong></p>
            
            <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people because it gives them a new perspective on their brain and helps them to see that the brain is not static but malleable, constantly capable of reshaping and learning new things. It blows the phrase 'can't teach an old dog new tricks' right out of the water.</p>

            <p>The brain is a muscle and can be developed in any area, from learning coding to improving work performance to something as simple as hitting the gym and increasing flexibility. The neurons in the brain are like pathways, and the more you walk a certain path, the easier it is to find your way along it. Simply having an understanding of neuroplasticity is beneficial to me because I can apply it to everything that I do. I can face new situations, accept that they may be difficult and explore them anyway, comfortable in the knowledge that my brain is capable of creating new pathways and learning new things.</p>

            <p>You can increase the neuroplasticity of your brain by practicing new things and exploring new situations and environments. By introducing your brain to something new, you automatically begin the process of rewiring the pathways that have taken root up there. The key is continuing to practice––as I said earlier, the more you walk it, the more defined the path becomes.</p>

         <p><strong>Growth Mindset</strong></p>
            
            <p>Growth mindset is all about the way you face a situation. With a fixed mindset, you can encounter the same challenge over and over again without ever learning from it because your mind refuses to see it in a new way. With a growth mindset, you can face the same challenge and learn new ways of overcoming and resolving it because you started out with the belief that you could.</p>

            <p>Nothing about this surprised me because my mum has always been a firm believer in neuroplasticity and growth mindset. However, it is always interesting to me to learn about it from other perspectives and resources (unsurprisingly, hearing it repeatedly from your mother can turn it into a bit of a drag).</p>

            <p>I will integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey by approaching the lessons in the course with an open mind. I will practice self-compassion in my learnings and be kind to myself when things aren't making sense. If I enact a growth mindset throughout, then even when things are hard, I can rest easy knowing that my brain is doing what it's supposed to––learning new concepts and restructuring old ones.</p>

         <p><strong>Blend with Learning Plan and Strategies</strong></p>
            
             <p>Knowing that I have the ability to learn new things, that my brain is malleable and capable of change, is enough to make all of this new coding information a lot less scary. It helps me to be more compassionate when I don't understand, and proud when I do. It influences me in such a way that I can breathe when nothing makes sense and know that at some point in the future––if I can only keep practicing and developing my skills, then eventually––it will make sense.</p>
