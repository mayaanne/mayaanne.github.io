            <h2>Problem Solving</h2> 
            
            <p>I get blocked on simple problems ON THE REG. Not that they feel simple––they usually just feel like a MARE. I couldn't figure out how to execute a function for the longest time and I kept flicking between the Repl.it questions and Google and for the life of me, just couldn't get it. Eventually, I had the epiphany of doing as the question itself suggested, using the text they'd suggested, and managed to solve the problem quick smart after that! It's frustrating when you continually get something wrong, but once you figure it out, there's nothing quite like it. From solving this simple problem, I learned that sometimes things are a lot simpler than expected and should be approached as such. Also, I'm not sure that I've solved any problems 'elegantly' yet. I'll let you know when that happens (will I even know???).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Psuedocode</strong> isn't something that I'm overly eager about, probably because I haven't quite figured out how it helps me. I'm a big advocate for just <strong>trying something</strong> because that basically equates to practice and practice is what enables improvement. The <strong>rubber ducky method</strong> isn't my friend yet, and I think that's mostly because I don't understand ANY concepts enough to be able to articulate them in a coherent way, to any rubber duck or anyone, and especially not to myself. <strong>Reading error messages</strong> doesn't really float my boat either. If the error message is complicated, then I've got NO CLUE how to resolve it, and if it's simple, I CAN resolve it but it still doesn't give me the answer to the overall problem. Sigh. <strong>console.logging</strong>––I tried, I really did. But I just couldn't quite grasp it. I'm hoping that the understanding will come, but the command still makes for some cloudy skies. <strong>Googling</strong> is ma jammmmmmm! It's definitely helped me the most throughout this whole kata experience. Though it can take some SWEET time to solve problems, it has been the most helpful problem solving technique for me thus far. <strong>Asking peers and coaches for help</strong> is definitely something that I should be doing more of, but something about it makes me feel like I'm cheating. Silly, I know. But I don't know how to phrase the question, and the only way to help someone who can't phrase a question is to give them the answer, and giving them the answer takes away the whole problem solving schtick anyway. GAHHHHHHHH. <strong>Refelction</strong> ABSOLUTELY helps with my improvement. Perhaps not in any sort of technical sense, but definitely in a way that it makes me more compassionate towards my own difficulties and shortcomings. In retrospect, I would tell you that the Sprints haven't been so bad, but also, I wouldn't have been able to say so at the time. I'm learning that beating myself up is pointless. It won't help me solve anything, let alone coding problems.</p>
